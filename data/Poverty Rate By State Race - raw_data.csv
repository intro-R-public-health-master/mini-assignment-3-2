Notes,,,,,,,,
"The majority of our health coverage topics are based on analysis of the Census Bureauâ€™s American Community Survey (ACS) by the Kaiser Family Foundation. ACS includes a 1% sample of the US population and allows for precise state-level estimates. Please note that in the past, health coverage data posted to this site had used the Current Population Survey. We have replaced all previously-posted data, including data for previous years, with data based on ACS.   ",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
Data are for the total population. Data may not sum to totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,

"The U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for a family with two adults and one child was $19,730 in 2017. This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid. For more information on measures of poverty, please see the detailed description provided by HHS: [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm). For 2016 and historical thresholds, use [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html).",,,,,,,,
